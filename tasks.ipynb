    "Prime numbers serve as fundamental building blocks in numerous computing applications:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cryptography**: RSA encryption is dependent on the difficulty of factoring large prime numbers\n",
    "- **Random Number Generation**: Prime numbers assist in the production of high quality random sequences\n",
    "- **Hash Functions**: ALot of hash algorithms use prime numbers as multipliers\n",
    "- **Error Correction**: Prime based code help find and recover from transmission faults\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithms implemented show two fundamental approaches to prime generation:\n",
    "- **Trial Division**: Straightforward and intuitive, but computationally costly\n",
    "- **Sieve of Eratosthenes**: More complex conceptually, but more efficient\n",
    "\n",
    "These algorithms illustrate a common trade off in computer science between simplicity and performance, with the mostcomplex approach providing more benefits for larger datasets. As noted in [Introduction to Algorithms](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms-third-edition), \"the sieve of Eratosthenes is a practical way to find all small primes.\""
