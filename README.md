# ComputationalTheory

Overview
This repository contains my submission for the Computational Theory assessment for the 2024/2025 academic year. The assessment consists of a series of tasks outlined in tasks.md, which are implemented in the Jupyter notebook tasks.ipynb.

The project demonstrates problem-solving skills in computational theory, including automata theory, formal languages, complexity analysis, and other theoretical concepts.
